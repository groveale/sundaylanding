Every Sunday morning I'd wake up with good intentions. Read the book on my nightstand. Go for a long walk. Actually cook breakfast instead of scrolling through food photos while eating cereal.

Then I'd turn off my alarm, and somehow end up forty-five minutes deep in Instagram before I'd even gotten out of bed.

It wasn't a willpower problem. Willpower is a finite resource, and the apps I was using are designed by teams of engineers specifically to defeat it. I was bringing a spoon to a knife fight.

## The problem with existing solutions

I tried screen time limits. They work until you tap "allow 15 more minutes" — and then you do that six times. The friction isn't high enough.

I tried app blocking apps. Most of them are either too aggressive (blocking everything, all day) or too fiddly (setting up different schedules per app per day). I just wanted one day. Sundays.

I wanted something that understood the shape of the problem: **not every day, just Sunday**.

## What Sunday Unplugged does differently

The key insight is that the day is the unit, not the hour. Most digital wellness tools think in minutes and hours. But rest doesn't work like that — you need a full day to decompress, not a 2-hour window.

Sunday Unplugged blocks your chosen apps every Sunday, automatically. No decision to make every week. No scheduling. You pick your apps once, and then Sunday is defended.

The other thing I cared about: **no accounts, no data leaving your device**. I didn't want to hand my app usage patterns to another company. Everything lives locally on your phone.

## What happened when I started using it

The first Sunday was uncomfortable, honestly. I kept reaching for my phone and getting the calm redirect screen. But by the afternoon, I'd finished a book I'd had on my nightstand for three months.

The second Sunday I barely noticed the blocks. I went to a farmer's market. Had a long coffee. Came home and cooked a proper lunch.

By the third Sunday something had shifted. I woke up and didn't even reach for my phone.

That's what I was building towards. Not an app that fights your phone — an app that trains you to want a different kind of Sunday.
